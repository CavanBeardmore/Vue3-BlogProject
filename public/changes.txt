posts: {
edit button (only see these is created the post or if admin)
toggling the view of search, view posts create posst needs to change to a universal toggle {
    have a ref for create, search, own posts all set to false,
    have a ref for posts set to true, 
    have buttons for e
}

}

using edit post activates it for all posts needs to be singular perhaps posts component for each?
